# Visual Code Generator 
This project is about creating an interactable coding surface that allows users who have never experienced code to understand it
in a better way. The basic UI uses a two click system that is able to keep track of its origin and connected elements through some 
form of object oriented programming.

Current Languages Used:
- Javascript
